  Create and Dial VPN Entry MVVM WPF Example

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

  This example demonstrates how to create and dial a virtual private
  network (VPN) entry in a Windows phone book, and how to dial that entry.
  This example uses the MVVM architectural pattern and Windows Presentation 
  Foundation (WPF) for the user interface.


Supported OS:

  Windows 2000 and later


Usage:

  Once the application has started, click the "Create" button. This
  will generate the new entry in the All Users' profile phone book. Next
  click the Dial button to initiate dialing the new connection. To disconnect
  the connection attempt, click the disconnect button once enabled. As the 
  status of the connection attempt changes, the textbox will display the
  information.
